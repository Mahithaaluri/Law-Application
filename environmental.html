        <h1>Environmental Law - Case Details</h1>
    </header>
    <div class="container">
        Environmental law encompasses a body of legal principles, statutes, regulations, and treaties that aim to protect and preserve the natural environment and address environmental issues.<br>
        It governs human activities that may impact the environment, including pollution, resource exploitation, habitat destruction, and biodiversity loss. Environmental law addresses a wide range of concerns,<br>
        such as air and water quality, waste management, land use planning, conservation of natural resources, and the regulation of toxic substances. It also includes provisions for environmental impact assessments, 
        permitting processes, and enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance with environmental regulations.
