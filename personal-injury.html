    <div class="container">
        Personal injury cases involve legal disputes that arise when an individual suffers harm or injury due to the negligence, recklessness, or intentional actions of another party.<br>
        These cases encompass a wide range of incidents, including car accidents, slip and fall accidents, medical malpractice, workplace injuries, defective products, and assaults. In a personal injury case,<br>
        the injured party, known as the plaintiff, seeks compensation for damages such as medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and emotional distress. The defendant, typically the party responsible for causing the injury, may be an individual,
        corporation, government entity, or other organization.
