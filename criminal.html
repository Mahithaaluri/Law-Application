    <div class="container">
        A criminal case refers to a legal proceeding initiated by the government against an individual or entity accused of committing a crime. <br>
        These cases are brought before a criminal court and typically involve the prosecution, represented by government attorneys, and the defendant, who is accused of the criminal offense.

<h2>2.Jessica Lal Murder Case:</h2> Jessica Lal, a model and bartender, was shot and killed at a party in a restaurant in Delhi in 1999.

<h2>3.2008 Mumbai Attacks:</h2>In November 2008, a series of coordinated terrorist attacks took place in Mumbai, targeting multiple locations, including hotels, a railway station, and a Jewish center.

Several attackers were killed during the siege, while the lone surviving attacker, Ajmal Kasab, was captured and later sentenced to death.<br>

<h2>4.Shah Bano Case: </h2>This landmark case in 1985 involved Shah Bano, a Muslim woman seeking maintenance from her husband after their divorce.

<h2>6.Aarushi Talwar Murder Case:</h2> Aarushi Talwar, a 14-year-old girl, was found murdered in her home in Noida in 2008.

<h2>7.Bhopal Gas Tragedy:</h2> In 1984, a catastrophic gas leak occurred at the Union Carbide pesticide plant in Bhopal, resulting in thousands of deaths and injuries.

<h2>8.Sanjeev Nanda BMW Hit-and-Run Case:</h2> In 1999, Sanjeev Nanda, the grandson of a former Indian Navy Chief, was involved in a hit-and-run accident in Delhi, resulting in the deaths of six people.
